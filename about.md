I am a senior research engineer in LG Electronics, Korea. I am in charge of developing `Hotword` detection. Have you tried `OK Google`, `LG Mobile`, or `Hello Genie` on LG G3? That's what I wrote.

I am familiar with 

*   Python : always with it
*   C/C++ : developed `speech recognition engine`
*   Git, SVN : can't imagine without it
*   Ubuntu : always with it

You can find me in

*   [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/553095/mskimm)

or email me
