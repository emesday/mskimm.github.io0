Do you plan to make a hotword?

#### Preliminary

Sorry for my English

Hotword used for always-listening would be

 - easy and friendly
 - not frequently used in the real world
 - more than two words

#### Why easy and friendly?

The hotword is uttered by human, so it is easy to pronounce. Also hotword feels like calling a robot because the user will command after hotword.

#### Why not frequently used?

The hotword is detected in the continuous speech signal. If the frequently used word will be detected unintentionally.

#### Two word or more

Less than? False acceptance increases.

#### EX) OK Google ?

How long have you met 'Google'? Your answer will explain How much we are familiar Google. OK? Even though my native language is not English, I always say OK. The two words are easy and friendly. However the combination is never used before Google launched it.
